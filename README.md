# Pokemon-battle-prediction-system
The problem statement of this project is to develop a Pokémon battle prediction system.  It should be able to determine the Pokémon with higher chances of winning in a Pokémon battle.  For this, relevant data of Pokémon generation, types and statistics is obtained. The system will include the following primary modules/components: statistics display, generation display and strength comparison, type comparison, determining whether legendary or not and most importantly, type-based Pokémon battle prediction.
